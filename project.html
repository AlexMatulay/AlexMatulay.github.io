   <h1>Data Science project 2022</h1> 
   
<h2>Energy consumption and an incentive for a green transition in Europe</h2>
<h3>Aims</h3>
<p>With the ongoing energy crisis, it is important to know which energy sources are mainly used 
    in our daily consumption. Europe is currently facing serious discussions regarding its current energy 
    set-up. This project is not trying to solve the ongoing short-term energy crisis, but rather aims to look 
    further into the future in a search for a long-term solution. Some countries in the EU have aimed to reduce 
    their consumption of fossil fuels more than other countries in the past few decades. It is important for 
    other countries to follow this trend and look towards more renewable sources of energy. </p> 
    <p>Hence, this project 
        aims to summarize the development of energy consumption in the EU and Europe in the last few decades and 
        hints towards using more renewable sources of energy. </p>

    <h3>Data</h3>
    <p>The data used in this project has been obtained from various sources. 
        Eurostat was used more than once since it provides a great range of data 
        for European countries. Most of the data was downloaded in csv files. </p>
        <p>I mainly tried to restrict the data to EU countries but then in some examples 
            I have either used data for all countries in Europe or in one example I have used 
            data for the whole world. This has been done to increase the significance of the results or to 
            achieve a better geographical picture of the maps. </p>
      <p>In the maps, certain countries may disappear in certain years. This is because the values 
        for those years are missing. For example, the UK disappears in year 2020 in the per capita 
        greenhouse gas emissions map. This is because the UK has left the EU and the data was no 
        longer there. </p>   
        <p>Wikipedia was scrapped to obtain data for the number of nuclear reactors. 
            The google collab notebook can be viewed

            </p>   

            <h3>Challenges in data cleaning</h3>
            <p>In the topojson, the map of Europe has different names for certain countries 
                compared to the country names in some datasets. For example, the Czech Republic 
                is sometimes called Czechia in some data sets. Without changing the name in the 
                dataset to Czech Republic, the map would not include Czech Republic. 
                Therefore, I had to manually change the names of some countries in the data sets 
                to match the names in the topojson map. </p>

           <p>When merging datasets, the data was edited in excel with the use of formulae to 
            match the same dates. For example, two data sets were matched using a match formula 
            in the scatter plots dataset. It took me a lot of time to find the correct formula to do 
            this. But this had to be done to avoid any mismatch errors when merging datasets manually. </p>  
            
            <p>The data was edited in excel after scraping the Wikipedia website to obtain data 
                for the number of reactors. This is because my python skills are limited, and it 
                was easier to do it in excel. For future replication/automation it would have been better to clean the 
            data in python. </p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>To conclude, there is still a prevalent use of fossil fuels in the EU, with oil being the predominant 
    source of energy. It has, however, been on a decline in the past few years. </p>
    <p>The European Union has been trying to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by introducing the 
        EU Emissions Trading System. Its impact on greenhouse gas emission can be seen since its 
        introduction in 2005 which can be observed in the first map. Further work could be done to 
        study the direct impact of the EU Trading System on greenhouse gas emissions. </p>
        <p>There is a slight upwards trend between the overall happiness index and the use of 
            renewable energy. More work could be done in identifying which energy sources contribute more
             or less to the overall happiness index, or a study could be made to identify which energy sources 
             are people most satisfied with.  </p>
             <p>Nuclear energy, which can be considered as renewable, provides a reliable, safe, 
                and clean source of energy. Switzerland has the same number of active nuclear
                 reactors as Hungary, but Switzerland’s GDP is more than twice the GDP of Hungary. 
                 This shows that there isn’t a link between GDP and the number of active nuclear reactors. 
                 Nuclear energy is, however, stigmatized by the public and more work could be done to inform 
                 the public about the advantages of this source of energy. If you are interested in reading 
                 my opinion on nuclear energy, please click <a href="OpEd.html" class="link" id="link2">here</a> </p>
