    <h1>The future of the EU’s energy is nuclear </h1>
    <h3>Alex Matulay, October 2022</h3>
    <p>The Ukrainian war is affecting every European citizen. Ukrainians are 
        fighting for their survival and the rest of the continent is fighting 
        the soaring energy prices that are caused by the greed of Vladimir Putin. 
        The European Union is a net importer of energy. The European Commission 
        estimated that 58% of the EU’s energy was imported in 2020. The world economic 
        forum states that in 2021 the EU imported $108 billion worth of oil and natural 
        gas from Russia. The Russian president has leverage on the EU’s energy security 
        which can be observed since the invasion of Ukraine. The way forward is an 
        energy-independent European Union which cannot be achieved without nuclear energy.  </p>
        <p>Nuclear power plants, which are expected to operate for at least 60 years since 
            their construction, contribute to price stability and energy independence by providing 
            a reliable source of energy. Nuclear energy is reliable because it doesn’t require 
            constant refuelling. A typical nuclear power plant changes its source once every 18 
            to 24 months. Whereas coal or natural gas plants require a constant supply of fuel. 
            Up until the invasion of Ukraine, natural gas has been mainly imported to the EU from
             Russia by pipelines. But since coal cannot flow through pipelines, the constant need
              to resupply coal power plants has exposed coal to a series of supply chain problems. 
              For example, the drought season this summer has effectively closed the traffic in 
              certain parts of the Rhine river in Germany which has affected the supply of coal 
              to the EU’s power plants. Natural gas is unreliable because it is exposed to high 
              price fluctuations. This can be observed in the market price development in the past 
              two years. Tradingeconomics.com shows that the market price in August 2022 was 22 times 
              higher than in April 2022. This has been caused mainly by the unreliability of the majority 
              supplier: Russia. According to the world economic forum, Russian gas accounted for 40% of 
              the European Union’s total gas consumption in 2021. Russia decreased the supply of natural 
              gas to continental Europe by 60% since June 2021, breaching their contractual obligations,
               hence making themselves and natural gas no longer a reliable source of energy. </p>
               <p>Nuclear energy has positive impacts on health and safety. It is the second safest 
                and healthiest source of energy, after solar. Our world in data has estimated that 
                death rates caused by air pollution and accidents from coal power plants cause 24.6 
                deaths per terawatt-hour whereas nuclear only 0.03. This is important because CREA 
                estimated that the costs of pollution from fossil fuels in 2018 resulted in $2.9 
                trillion or 3.3% of the world GDP. An estimated 4.5 million people died due to 
                exposure to fossil fuel air pollution in the same year. The IEA states that 
                nuclear energy, the second lowest producer of low-carbon energy generation, 
                has reduced the CO2 emission by 2 years’ worth of global-related emissions 
                in the last 50 years. It emits 273 times fewer greenhouse gases than coal, 
                240 times fewer than oil, and 163 times fewer than natural gas. Fossil fuels
                 are the most dangerous and dirtiest sources of energy. Nuclear being one of 
                 the safest, safer than wind energy, still faces fears from the public due 
                 to previous accidents in Chernobyl and Fukushima nuclear power plants. 
                 The nuclear powerhouses built today are designed to achieve optimum 
                 safety and have multiple safety systems to minimize the cause of a disaster. 
                 They include a series of physical barriers between the radioactive core and 
                 the outside environment, equipment that prevents human failures and errors 
                 from developing into problems, comprehensive monitoring equipment, and systems 
                 to prevent significant radioactive releases. For example, the nuclear power 
                 plants built in the U.S.A. are built to survive external attacks such as missile 
                 or commercial aircraft strikes. Such attacks would not cause a radiation leak. </p>
                 <p>If the European Union wants to achieve energy price stability it has to end its 
                    dependence on unreliable, unsafe, and dirty sources of energy. The price of natural 
                    gas has increased 22 times in less than two years making cheap Russian gas a thing 
                    of the past. Russia has proven that they are an unreliable source of energy, and 
                    the EU must adapt to this new reality. They have a clear alternative in front of
                     their eyes. It is time for Europeans to forget about the Chernobyl and Fukushima 
                     disasters because nuclear energy offers a reliable, clean, and very safe source of 
                     energy for decades to come. </p>
